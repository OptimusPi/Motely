# Motely

Motely is a fast Balatro seed searching library. It utilizes your CPU's 512-bit registers along with SIMD to search 8 seeds at once per thread.
It performs very well comapred to current GPU-based balatro seed searches (better in a lot of systems), and is the fastest general purpose CPU based searcher to my knowlegde. 

Thank you so much to [@OptimusPi](https://github.com/OptimusPi/) for commissioning the development of this library. It started out as a personal projects, but
would not have the capibilities it has today without his support.
