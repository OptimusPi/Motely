# Motely Filter Status Report

## Test Seed: ALEEB

1. **Joker Filter** 
   - Works for early shop slots (0-5 in Ante 2)
   - **BUG**: Does not check slot 7+ without extended slots

   - Blueprint at slot 7 in Ante 2: ❌ FAILS (needs extended slots)

2. **Voucher Filter**
   - Magic Trick in Ante 1: ✅ WORKS

4. **PlayingCard Filter**

### ❌ BROKEN Filters

1. **Boss Filter**

   - Does not track boss progression correctly
   - TheArm in Ante 2: ❌ FAILS

2. **Planet Filter**
   - **LIMITATION**: Only checks Celestial packs, not shop consumables
   - Saturn appears as shop consumable (slot 0) in Ante 2: ❌ NOT SUPPORTED
   - Mars in Celestial pack: ❌ FAILS (possibly wrong pack slot calculation)

3. **Tarot Filter**
   - **LIMITATION**: Likely only checks Arcana packs, not shop consumables
   - The Empress in shop slot 2 in Ante 1: ❌ NOT SUPPORTED
   - The Empress in Arcana pack slot 1: ❌ FAILS

## Filter Implementation Issues

### Critical Bugs:
1. **Joker Filter**: Default shop slots too limited (doesn't check slot 7+)
2. **Boss Filter**: Doesn't maintain state across antes
3. **Planet/Tarot Filters**: Don't check shop consumables, only packs

### Design Limitations:
1. Consumables (Planets, Tarots, Spectrals) appearing in shop are not searchable
2. Default slot ranges are too restrictive

## Sliced Filter Chain Status

The sliced filter chain mechanism itself **WORKS CORRECTLY**:
- Filters are properly grouped by category
- Chaining works when individual filters work
- The architecture is sound

The issues are with individual filter implementations, not the slicing/chaining mechanism.
